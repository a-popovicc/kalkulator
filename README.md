<h2>📌 Calculator – Java Swing Project</h2>

Smart desktop calculator built as my first larger Java project


<h3>📖Overview</h3>

This project represents my first serious Java application, created after learning the core programming fundamentals at university — control flow (loops and conditionals), working with arrays and matrices, basic object-oriented principles such as classes, objects, and abstract classes, as well as collections, text file handling, serialization, and the initial steps into GUI programming.

The goal of the project was to build a fully functional calculator inspired by the standard Windows calculator, but enhanced with support for parentheses, automatic parenthesis closing, and advanced event handling in which each button’s behavior dynamically adapts based on the user’s previous input.

It was written in Eclipse, using pure Java Swing, without FXML, Scene Builder, or any external libraries.

<h3>🧩Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Basic arithmetic operations</li>
<li>Parentheses support ()</li>
<li>Automatic bracket closing</li>
<li>Memory operations</li>
<li>Clear / All Clear logic</li>
<li>Input validation</li>
<li>Handling of multiple chained operations</li>
<li>Complex button behavior depending on previous context</li>
<li>Fully custom layout designed using Swing components</li>
</ul>
<h3>🛠️Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>Java 17</li>
<li>Java Swing for GUI</li>
<li>Eclipse IDE</li>
<li>OOP principles</li>
<li>Lambda expressions & Streams (used later in development with assistance)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What This Project Represents</h3>
This calculator was the first project in which I built a complex GUI from scratch, handled a large number of user events, and implemented custom logic behind many interacting buttons. It was also the point where I manually connected the UI with the business logic, structured a larger Java project independently, and began applying my early Java knowledge in a real, functional application.
This project marks the moment when my skills started shifting from basic programming exercises toward developing complete, fully-featured applications.

<h3>⚠ Known Limitations</h3>

This project is intentionally left as it originally was — to show how my skills looked at that time.
Some limitations include:
<br>🟡 Logic is not separated using MVC:
<br>A lot of computation and state management sits inside the GUI classes.
<br>🟡 Method names and comments are written in Serbian, which is not ideal for professional code bases.
Despite these points, the project fulfills its purpose as an educational milestone and portfolio piece.

<h3>🚀 Running the Application</h3>

Clone or download the repository.
Open the project in Eclipse (or any Java IDE).
Run the Calculator.java main class.
No additional dependencies are required.

<h3>📈Future Improvements (optional ideas)</h3>

Although the project is complete, future versions might include:
Migrating the UI to JavaFX,
introducing proper MVC architecture,
better input parsing,
reorganized button handlers,
unit testing for expression evaluation...

<h3>🙌 Acknowledgements</h3>

Some parts of the project (especially minor refactors using Streams and Lambdas) were improved with help from ChatGPT, who assisted in simplifying logic and solving specific problems during development.
